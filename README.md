## Question 1: 
Make all columns the correct size to fit all of the data.
- Add gridlines and borders.
- Add color to headers.
- Center your column titles.
- Check for null values.
## Question 2: 
Discount is shown as a fraction, where .5 means a 50% discount.  Total discount would be ('discount' x 'sales').  Create a column called Total Discount and use a formula that shows the total discount for all rows.
## Question 3: 
In the profit column, use conditional formatting to show red/pink when profit is below 0, and green when profit is 0 or above.  
## Question 4:
Insert a new column and call it "Time to ship".  Add a formula to calculate the number of days between order date and shipping date.  Format the column as a number (not as a date).
## Question 5: 
Insert another column and call it "Shipping status".  Add a rule to the column: if the value of "Time to ship" is less than or equal to 5 days, the value should be "on time".  If the "Time to ship"  is greater than 5 days, the value of status should be "delayed". 
## Question 6: 
Add a column called "Sales manager" and use vlookup to get the sales manager from the 'People' tab. 
## Question 7:
Create a pivot table in a new tab, showing total sales by region.   Add a pivot chart (a bar chart) showing region on the x-axis and total sales in the y axis. 
## Question 8:
Create another pivot table (in a new tab) showing product category in columns, subcategory in rows, and total profit in the values.   Create a pivot chart showing subcategories in the x axis and distinguish between categories using color (in the legend).  
## Question 9: 
Create a new worksheet and name it ’questions’. Copy the questions below onto the ‘questions’ worksheet and address the questions using whatever combination of pivot tables and charts you need to answer them.
- Are discounts too high (i.e. do subcategories with high discount have lower profit)?
- Which subcategories are losing money?
- Is this the same across all regions?
- Which region made the most profit over all the years?  
- In what year did the company make the most profit?
- During that year which were the highest earning product categories?
## Question 10
Create a dashboard by copying and pasting 2 pivot tables and charts into another worksheet, called ’dashboard’
